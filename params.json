{"name":"Monoriel","tagline":"A super simplistic but useful ruby web framework","body":"### Welcome to Monoriel GitHub Page\r\nThis page was generated automatically by github pages...\r\nBut i added this content for more examples of using Monoriel\r\n\r\n### What is Monoriel?\r\nMonoriel is an attempt to create a super simple Web Development Mini Framework, and believe me,\r\nmonoriel is quiet small. But it can create web apps using a simplistic approach by means of http verbs\r\nor something RESTful as it is known.\r\n\r\n### Why do i must use Monoriel?\r\nBecause is simple and can process Slim, Haml and Scss templates to generate Web Pages an Web Apps.\r\nYou can use any rack middleware with monoriel. You can create before an after filters an helper\r\nmethods for your app. Every method just need to be prefixed with the http method it responds, like\r\n\r\n    def index\r\n      render 'index'\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    def post_client\r\n      client = Client.new\r\n      client.name = params[\"name\"]\r\n      client.create\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    def put_client(id)\r\n      client = clients.read id\r\n      client.name = params[\"name\"]\r\n      client.update\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    def delete_client(id)\r\n      clients.destroy id\r\n    end\r\n\r\nas you see, you don't need to prefix GET methods and index is the default method\r\nwhen the / route is browsed.\r\n\r\n### Using layouts for templates\r\nAs you can note in the code above, there is a method called render. \r\nThis method is not part of Monoriel, in fact is a Helper method but you can write it:\r\n\r\n    helpers do\r\n      def render template\r\n        slim :layout do\r\n           slim template.to_sym\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n      def redirect dir\r\n        @res.redirect dir\r\n      end\r\n      def params\r\n        @r.params\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nand that's all, now you have **layout supporting** for Slim templates engine, but you can\r\ndo the same for haml, or erb, just code render method as shown above.I have included the\r\n**redirect** and **params** methods which are something common for use in an app.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMonoriel was forked from mini-train which was forked from rack/golem by me\r\nyou can download as a gem from rubygems using:\r\n\r\n    sudo gem install monoriel\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nIf you have some troubles using Monoriel, please send me an email to:\r\n>carlitos.esquer  at  gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
